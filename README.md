Test all the URLs in a text file
=================

This is a super simple command-line application to find and test the URLs in a file. 

If you want to do this on a .doc/.docx, or any other non-plaintext thing, I recommend that you copy and paste it into a .txt file; it should work OK, then.

Itâ€™s a little buggy with the URLs in an HTML file, but it more or less works.
